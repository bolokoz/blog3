## Por que não temos?

- Temos madeira no Brasil e a tecnologia já está bem explorada
- Casas no geral estão com preços absurdos
- Padrão de qualidade das casas tradicionais é ruim
- Mão de obra cada vez mais cara

Acho que só aí já preenche um business model canvas

### Lista de passos

1. Research and Planning: The first step is to research the prefab housing industry and identify the specific niche or market you want to serve. You should also develop a business plan that outlines your goals, target market, budget, and marketing strategy.
2. Design and Engineering: Once you have a clear idea of what type of prefab houses you want to manufacture, you'll need to work with architects and engineers to design the houses and create detailed blueprints and specifications.
3. Materials and Suppliers: You'll need to identify the materials and suppliers you'll need to manufacture the prefab houses. This includes sourcing high-quality materials at a competitive price.
4. Factory Set-up: You'll need to set up a manufacturing facility that is capable of producing the prefab houses efficiently and at a high level of quality. This includes installing production equipment, hiring staff, and ensuring compliance with local building codes and regulations.
5. Manufacturing Process: You'll need to develop a manufacturing process that is efficient and maximizes the use of materials and labor. This includes creating a detailed production schedule and implementing quality control measures to ensure that each house meets your standards.
6. Marketing and Sales: You'll need to create a marketing and sales strategy to promote your prefab houses and reach your target market. This includes developing a website, creating marketing materials, attending trade shows, and building relationships with contractors and developers.
7. Shipping and Delivery: Once the houses are manufactured, they will need to be shipped to their final destination. You'll need to work with logistics companies to ensure that the houses are shipped safely and on time.
8. Installation and After-sales Service: Finally, you'll need to provide installation services for the prefab houses and offer after-sales service and support to your customers. This includes handling any warranty claims or repairs and ensuring customer satisfaction.
